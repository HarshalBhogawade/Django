# Django Overview

Django is a powerful Python web framework designed to help you build robust, scalable web applications quickly. Below is a beginner-friendly overview of key Django concepts, explained in simple terms, with two important code lines for each topic and a short explanation.

---

## 1. What is Django?
- Django is a free and open-source framework for building web apps with Python.
- It was created to make web development fast, clean, and pragmatic.
- Django helps developers avoid repetitive tasks by providing ready-to-use components.
- It encourages best practices and clean code organization.
- Many large websites use Django due to its reliability and scalability.

**Code Example:**
```python
import django
print(django.get_version())
```
*This imports Django and prints its version, confirming Django is installed and working.*

---

## 2. Designing Models
- Models are Python classes that define the structure of your app’s data.
- Each model maps to a table in your database, describing what data is stored and how it relates.
- Django’s built-in ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) lets you interact with your data using Python instead of SQL.
- You define models by writing Python code, making it easy to update and maintain your database schema.
- Models are the foundation for all data-related operations in Django.

**Code Example:**
```python
class Reporter(models.Model): full_name = models.CharField(max_length=70)
class Article(models.Model): reporter = models.ForeignKey(Reporter, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```
*These lines define two models and set up a relationship between them using Django's ORM.*

---

## 3. Database Setup and Migrations
- Django automates database creation and updates using migrations.
- Migrations are files that record changes to your models and help keep your database in sync.
- Running simple commands will create or update database tables for you.
- This process saves time and reduces errors compared to manual database management.
- You can focus on your code, while Django handles the technical details of your database.

**Code Example:**
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
*These commands create migration files from your models and apply them to build/update your database tables.*

---

## 4. Free Python API for Data
- Django gives you a powerful API to create, read, update, and delete data using Python.
- You can easily fetch records, filter results, and manage relationships between data.
- The API is intuitive and does not require you to write database queries directly.
- This allows you to manipulate data efficiently and safely.
- The API also makes testing and debugging easier for beginners.

**Code Example:**
```python
r = Reporter(full_name="John Smith"); r.save()
Reporter.objects.all()
```
*The first line creates and saves a Reporter object; the second fetches all Reporter objects from the database.*

---

## 5. The Django Admin Interface
- Django generates a professional, user-friendly admin website automatically.
- The admin lets you add, edit, and remove data through a secure backend.
- You only need to register your models to get a working admin panel.
- This feature is ideal for teams or clients who need to manage content.
- The admin saves developers from having to build custom management tools from scratch.

**Code Example:**
```python
from django.contrib import admin
admin.site.register(Article)
```
*Registering the Article model makes it manageable in the admin interface.*

---

## 6. URL Design (URLconf)
- Django uses a clean and flexible system for mapping URLs to code.
- You define patterns that tell Django which function to call for each URL.
- This keeps your URLs readable and free from unnecessary details like file extensions.
- You can capture parameters from URLs to create dynamic pages.
- Django’s URL system makes your app easier to navigate and maintain.

**Code Example:**
```python
path("articles/<int:year>/", views.year_archive)
path("articles/<int:year>/<int:month>/<int:pk>/", views.article_detail)
```
*These URL patterns link specific paths to your view functions, capturing data from the URL.*

---

## 7. Views: Handling Requests
- Views are Python functions that process incoming web requests and return responses.
- They retrieve data, apply logic, and choose which templates to render.
- Views separate your app’s business logic from its presentation.
- Each view is responsible for creating the right output for each URL.
- Writing views helps you control what users see and interact with on your site.

**Code Example:**
```python
def year_archive(request, year): a_list = Article.objects.filter(pub_date__year=year)
return render(request, "news/year_archive.html", {"year": year, "article_list": a_list})
```
*This view fetches articles for a year and renders them in a template.*

---

## 8. Templates: Building Web Pages
- Templates are files that define how your web pages look.
- They let you mix static HTML with dynamic data from your models.
- Django’s template system supports reusable layouts and simple syntax.
- You can extend base templates to avoid repeating code for common elements.
- Templates make it easy to update your site’s design without changing its logic.

**Code Example:**
```
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% for article in article_list %}{{ article.headline }}{% endfor %}
```
*The first line lets your template inherit from a base layout; the second loops over articles to display headlines.*

---

## 9. Advanced Features
- Django includes caching to speed up your site and save resources.
- It offers tools for creating RSS and Atom feeds with minimal code.
- The admin panel has many customization options for more complex needs.
- Django is highly flexible—you can use your own database, templates, or extra Python code.
- The community and documentation provide plenty of support for learning and troubleshooting.

**Code Example:**
```python
from django.core.cache import cache
cache.set('key', 'value', timeout=60)
```
*These lines show how to set a cached value using Django’s caching framework.*

---

# Writing Your First Django App (Part 1)

This guide will help you start building a simple polls application using Django. The app will have a public site for voting and an admin site for managing polls.

---

## 1. Check Django Installation
- Ensure Django is installed by running:  
  `python -m django --version`
- This command will display your installed Django version.
- Django 5.2 works with Python 3.10 and later.
- If you get an error, install Django first or refer to the docs for your version.
- Make sure your Python and Django versions are compatible.

---

## 2. Create a Django Project
- Use the command:  
  `django-admin startproject mysite djangotutorial`
- This will create the project folder and essential setup files.
- The project includes configuration for database and application settings.
- Avoid naming your project after built-in Python or Django components.
- The project folder contains `manage.py` for administration and a package for your settings.

---

## 3. Understand Project Structure
- Your folder will look like:
  ```
  djangotutorial/
      manage.py
      mysite/
          __init__.py
          settings.py
          urls.py
          asgi.py
          wsgi.py
  ```
- `manage.py`: Tool for running commands and managing the project.
- `mysite/`: Contains your main project code and configurations.
- `settings.py`: Where you control settings like database and installed apps.
- `urls.py`: Handles routing URLs to views.
- `asgi.py`/`wsgi.py`: Entry points for different server types.

---

## 4. Run the Development Server
- Change to your project directory and run:  
  `python manage.py runserver`
- This starts Django’s built-in development server for rapid prototyping.
- Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser to verify it works.
- You will see a default Django welcome page.
- Do not use this server in production; it’s for development only.

---

## 5. Create a Polls App
- Apps are reusable units – run:  
  `python manage.py startapp polls`
- This command creates a folder named `polls` with boilerplate files:
  - `views.py`, `models.py`, `admin.py`, etc.
- Projects can contain multiple apps; apps can be used in different projects.
- Organize all poll-related code in this folder.
- You’ll build your voting logic and interface here.

---

## 6. Write Your First View
- In `polls/views.py`, add:
  ```python
  from django.http import HttpResponse
  def index(request): return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the polls index.")
  ```
- Views process requests and return responses to users.
- This basic view just returns a simple string to the browser.
- Every function-based view takes a request and returns a response.
- You’ll later connect this view to a URL so users can access it.

---

## 7. Map the View to a URL
- In `polls/urls.py`, add:
  ```python
  from django.urls import path
  from . import views
  urlpatterns = [path("", views.index, name="index")]
  ```
- URLconfs define how requests are routed to views.
- The path `""` means this view will respond at `/polls/`.
- Organizing URLs keeps your code modular and maintainable.
- Each app can have its own URLconf for flexibility.
- This step lets Django know how to direct browser requests.

---

## 8. Include App URLs in Project URLs
- In `mysite/urls.py`, import and use `include()`:
  ```python
  from django.contrib import admin
  from django.urls import include, path
  urlpatterns = [path("polls/", include("polls.urls")), path("admin/", admin.site.urls)]
  ```
- This connects the polls app’s URLs to the main project.
- `include()` lets you plug app URLs into the project’s routing.
- You can easily reuse apps in different projects with this structure.
- Only the admin site doesn’t need `include()` – it’s pre-configured.
- Now, visiting `/polls/` routes to your polls app.

---

## 9. Test Your Polls View
- Run the server:  
  `python manage.py runserver`
- Visit `http://localhost:8000/polls/` in your browser.
- You should see: “Hello, world. You’re at the polls index.”
- This confirms your view and URL setup are correct.
- If you get a “Page not found”, check your URLs and directory structure.

---

## 10. Next Steps
- Explore how Django processes requests and sends responses.
- You’re ready to build more complex views and connect to databases.
- Continue with the official tutorial to add models and admin features.
- Learn how to handle forms, templates, and user input.
- Django’s modular structure makes building web apps efficient and enjoyable!
